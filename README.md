BETTERWORLD COIN
WHAT DEFINES THE PRICE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY

Supply/Demand
  

As with most currencies or commodities supply and demand is a strong factor in the cryptocurrency market. Demand refers to how much (quantity) of a product or service is desired by buyers. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The correlation between price and how much of a good or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.

With reference to supply, BETTERWORLDCOIN is capped for the next ten years, thereafter increasing at a rate of just 8% per annum, thus supply is limited. 50% of the currency is directly held by the BETTERWORLDCOIN Fund under a series of smart contracts, the first being held until the end of Q2 2018, this greatly reduces supply. Supply is further curtailed once the fund is active as it is to be drip fed into the marketplace over the course of ten years. 15% of the remaining coins will be given away by airdrop for the public and the 10% are allocated to early investors and the BETTERWORLDCOIN Foundation. The remaining 25% coins will add to various trading  platform to raise fund for charity projects.

Demand will be ensured through a number of methods, most notably donations to well-known charitable organisations. Every donation made to charity will raise the profile of BETTERWORLDCOIN amongst consumers and businesses alike. Charities that are due to receive donations will be encouraged to accept BETTERWORLDCOIN as a donation method. This in turn will increase the awareness and subsequently the price of BETTERWORLDCOIN and thus increase the value of the donation that charity is due to receive. To ensure that BETTERWORLDCOIN remains a popular topic of discourse within the mainstream media, there will be varied donation plan which will include donating to high profile causes, taking part in high profile fundraisers, donating to struggling charities, social charities and particularly emotive and well documented causes. The BETTERWORLDCOIN foundation will ensure that donations made create the greatest benefit for the recipients whilst balancing the need for the promotion and adoption of BETTERWORLDCOIN.
